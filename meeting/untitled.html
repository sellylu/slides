Sounds of Silence: <br> Exploring Contributions to Conversations, Non-Responses and the Impact of Mediating Technologies in *Triple Space*

## Dual Factor Space
* Both social and cognitive
* People need to manage their internal production of ‘computational thinking,’ and their social skills in managing group processes.
* Joint problem-solving in dual space requires each participant to both make his/her own
thinking .pink[visable] to the group, and to recognize other participant's thinking.

## Triple Space
<br><br>

## Triple Space (Cont.)
People are
* required to allocate and manage their attentions in carrying out perceptible .blue[social interactions] within .pink[cotemporal/cospacial] settings.
* managing concealed cognitively-engrossing digital interatction through .pink[transtemporal/transspatial] .blue[digital media].
* expected to operate across these two heterogeneous interactional channels, the social and the digital. (.blue[cognitive])
---
## Triple Space and situational dilemmas
* They must behave in a way that defines the "current purposes" when several different possible goals are palpable.
* They must choose mechanisms of engagement with others.
* They must take action in a situation which affects other people but in which the goodness
of the action may very difficult to infer or may not be know for a considerable lag.

## Research Question
To investigate triple space interactions and comparing different mediating technology:
1. How triads attain and maintain mutual understandings of the current activities differently from dyads?
2. If and how the choices of the technological medium impact the grounding process among the triads?

---
## Common Ground (Clark)
* How people build and maintain mutual understanding in carring out joint actions
in the moment of the interaction.
* To attain mutual understandings, conversants collaboratively create units of conversation called .pink[***contributions***].
* Through contributions, interlocutors in conversation collectively try to establish the mutual belief
 that everyone has a good enough understanding of what is being discussed at the moment for their current purposes.
 * .pink[Common ground] means what people in the conversation need to know for mutual understanding.
 * .pink[Grounding] is th e process of attainging and maintaining mutual understanding among people in the conversation.
* CMC may impair grounding processes, but with proper design, the mutual understanding and satisifaction with the group
process could be improved.

---
## Three party vs. two-party interactions
* Information distribution among the group members affected the grounding process
and that triadic interactions required more work in the grounding process as compare
to dyadic interaction.
* This paper tries to extend Clark's theory to apply beyond dyads.

## Failure to Signal Repairs
* In a dyad, current purposes can easily be seen as a unitary outcome.<br>
In a triad, we can't not know that whether there is, at any given time, a single
unitary notion of joint action, or several, separate dyadic notions.
* If two people have problem with their communication, they could repair it through the process.<br>
If there is more than two people, failure to signal the need for repair would occur.
* Also, there would be ambiguity about who is the recipient of any particular cmomunication,
an non-response may be taken by a speaker or actor as affirmation orf understanding by the listener or
viewer who is assumed to be paying attention.
* There may be expectation gap.
---
## The Study
* Two-phase, between subject experiment.
* Conditon: Paper, tablet and PC
* Participants worked as a group to solve 2 Sudoku games.
* Total of 138 particiapnts, 24 dyads and 30 triads.
* PANAS scale after each game.
---
## Methods
* Video recorded and transcribed: intonation, conversational turn units, and non-verbal gestures.
* Identify non-responses places: apply the extended contribution models, coded each conversational turn for .blue[Pr (Presense)] and
.blue[Ac (Acceptance)].<br>
If there's no acceptance, then it's identified as a .blue[non-responses place].
---
## Different kinds of Non-Responses
* Thinking to oneself: .green[Thinking-out-loud], .green[Thinking-to-Things], .green[Self-Answering]
* Interrupted and Delayed Contributions: .green[delayed-contribution], .green[interrupted-contribution]
* Absent Response: .green[type 1], .green[type 2]

## Discourse Findings - Dyadic Orientation within the Triad
.img-60[![alt text](img/31.PNG)]
* This suggests that establishing plausible beliefs that the contents of their
conversation are understood depends on it being understood by a single other. <br>
Dyadic sense-making may be seen to suffice even in the triad.

## Discourse Findings - Two Concomitant Dyadic Orientation
.img-60[![alt text](img/32.png)]
* The notion of .blue[good enoughness] is not bound to the whole group, but rather it is a unique
attribute of each dyadic pair.<br>
* What is good enough for Ann and Cain is different from what is good enough for Ann and Ben.
---
## Discourse Findings - Current Purposes
* The notion of .blue[good enough understanding] is defined by Clark and his collegues as relateding to .blue[current purposes].
* Individuals may change their current purposes during the collaboration.
* Multiple current purposes can coexist, each having different levels of effort tolerance thresholds.

---
## Numerical Findings
* The data shows that 8.70% of *Presentations* had no matching *Acceptances* from both player, and
43.69% of *Presentation* did not have a matching *Acceptance* from one player.<br>
People still can conduct joint activites without fulyl establishing the mutual belief that everyone has
understood the contents of conversation.
* Groups are happier when they have low rates of non-responses.
* Mediating technonlogy affect the way non-responses were manifested in group interactions.<br>
